I am a Ph.D student at University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Oleg Sokolsky](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sokolsky/) and Professor [Insup Lee](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml). 

I am a member of [PRECISE](https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/) at Penn.

My research interests include runtime verification, formal verification and model-based development.
